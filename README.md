SkipLists
=========
For	Part	1	of	the	Project:

What	types	of	data	sets	did	you	construct?
Some	suggestions:		you	might	just	insert	the	elements	1..1000	into	a	skip	list
in	a	variety	of	ways	(increasing	order	without	repeats,	with	repeats,
clustered	values	between	1..1000,	a	much	larger	data	set,	random	orders,	etc.
Be	creative	and	try	different	types	of	data	sets)


Did	you	compare	different	ways	of	extending	the	Skip	list?
For	example,		you	could	insert	the	element	into	a	new	list	until	the	coin	flip	=
tails	(regardless	of	how	many	levels	this	adds),	or	you	could	stop	when	you
add	a	single	new	list.

What	did	you	discover	about	the	height	of	the	skip	list?		And,	how	balanced	does	it
“look?”

Think	about	good	ways	to	present	your	data	and	compare	it	to	what	you
would	get	in	from	the	theoretical	prediction.

How	did	you	design	data	sets	for	analyzing	the	query	time?

Did	you	test	this	at	the	same	time	as	you	built	the	Skip	List	or	after	the	list
was	constructed?			Did	you	skew	your	data	and	if	so	how?


How	did	the	number	of	“skip	forward”	and	“drop	down”	moves	compare	with	the
theoretical	predictions?


How	did	you	do	this	comparison?
